# QuestionForger

## Inspiration
As students, we understand the time-consuming and draining nature of exam studying. Sometimes, a little extra motivation, like introducing a challenge, can make a big difference. We believe that having questions of just the right difficulty can make learning more efficient and fun. After all, what's easy and hard varies from person to person!

## What it Does
QuestionForger allows users to practice for difficult university-level courses by competing against the question's internal value and other users in the system. It offers a variety of question types, adaptive difficulty levels, and a user-friendly interface, aiming to improve learning outcomes by engaging students in a dynamic and interactive assessment experience.

## How We Built It
The website was built using full-stack development. The frontend combines React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while the backend utilizes an SQL server.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Learning React was a challenge as none of us had first-hand experience with it before this project.
- Setting up the server and resolving machine-related issues was time-consuming.
- Fetching questions from the database was more complex than anticipated.

## What We Learned
- Full-stack development workflow.
- Using JSX and React.
- How to effectively connect a server with a database.

## What's Next for QuestionForger
We envision QuestionForger being used in classrooms where instructors and students (with the instructor's approval) can add questions to the pool. Our next step is to add a leaderboard to foster a fun, competitive environment.
